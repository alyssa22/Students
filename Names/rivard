Auto-Tune

I enjoy music and auto-tune has been used in the music industry since 1998 and is still being used today. It has made singers who weren't talented enough to be popular, popular. It has also been used to create a robot-like effect in songs that many people enjoy. Auto-tune has changed the music industry and will probably be used for many more years.
